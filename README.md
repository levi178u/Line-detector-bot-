# Line-detector-bot-
Line detector bot for controlling bot over a maze consisting of black, white lines and ramp in Arduino .“Tread-o-quest”, is an exciting tournament where teams of 3/4 compete with one another with their self-made bots, racing against time through a challenging track loaded with obstacles. My friend Souvik and I prepared this project for TOQ and it was a great learning and teamwork experience. First, we prepared the sensors for line detection, then design and final streamline implementation. We faced challenges in simulation and synching coding logic with hardware elements.

Thanks to our mentor, Ansuman Patro for guiding us.
